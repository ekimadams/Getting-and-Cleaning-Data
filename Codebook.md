Raw Data is pulled from <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a>
It is contained in a zipfile located <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">here</a>.

The zipfile contains multiple datasets including:
A features file with the recorded actions
A test set of data
A training set of data
Label indicators for the activities
Indicator of the subject of observations
Gyroscopic readings

Variables in the tidy datasets:
- Subject- The id of the person who recorded the observation
- Activity- Action performed for the observations
- Total Acceleration/Body acceleration/Gyro Acceleration - Large element vectors that detail specific data collected in the observations.  Labeled in the dataset using [action][Acc/gyro]-[mean/std]-[axis of movement(if any)] e.g. tBodyAcc-mean-X  



Summary and Design of merged tidy Dataset:

Created two datasets, one containing all datapoints for an observed action so one can see all the data collected.  And another one that averages the datapoints for a given subject/activity.

How `run_analysis.R` implements the above design:

1. Checks if the file exists, otherwise it downloads;
2. Checks if the file has already been extracted to the directory, if not, it extracts it;
3. Load both test and train data;
4. Load the features and activity labels;
5. Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data;
6. Process the data, update variable names to more user-friendly ones;
7. Merge and creates initial data set with all observations, and a secondary one averaging the observed datapoints based on the subject and the activity:
8. The result is saved as "./tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset-average.txt", a 180x68 data table (181 with column name), where as before, the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names (see below), and then the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

For each record it is provided:


- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:


- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Notes:

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
